# Mechatronics Challenge
Challenge for Mechatronics Engineers

### Goal
Design a prototype can output GPS coordinates and accelerometer data via serial USB.
â€‹
## Electrical/Programming
At Voyage, we are always trying to improve sensor data quality.  The objective of this challenge is to build a module that can output GPS coordinates and accelerometer data.  Assume clean 5V, 3A power source is provided and available.    

Using a Particle Photon microcontroller [https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/photon-(wifi)/photon-datasheet/#pin-and-button-definition](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/photon-(wifi)/photon-datasheet/#pin-and-button-definition) and a Carloop GPS [https://store.carloop.io/products/carloop-gps?variant=4846877966372](https://store.carloop.io/products/carloop-gps?variant=4846877966372) provide the following deliverables:

- a very simple wiring schematic showing how the GPS, accelerometer, and microcontroller can be wired together.
- a program in C++ that sends GPS coordinates and accelerometer data via serial USB (heavy use of existing libraries is recommended) 


## Mechanical
Design simple box to house all components. No constraints on size.

## Notes
If you'd prefer to use other microcontroller, accelerometer or GPS unit, feel free to do so.
